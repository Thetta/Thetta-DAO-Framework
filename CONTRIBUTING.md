# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

## Our Culture

- We are **open source only**.
- We are a **fully distributed** company – we don't care where you are located.
- We have almost no bureaucracy.
- We are a technology company.
