# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

## Our Culture

- We are **open source only**.
- We are a **fully distributed** company – we don't care where you are located. However, out core-team is located in Moscow, Russia.
- We have almost no bureaucracy.
- We are a technology company.

 ## Technologies/Languages we use
 - Our main goal is to build a community around our product. 

### Frontend code
We use **LiveScript** (CoffeeScript with a bit of functional programming) because this statistics of languages usage confirms that it is widely used in the community currently (as of Nov, 2017):
 
1) javascript - 900K repos
2) coffeescript - 26K repos
3) typescript - 5K repos
4) livescript - 0.6K repos

### Smart Contracts
We use Solidity language for smart contracts.

## Testing

Before you do any commit - please test your code. Refer to the **README.md** file for more info.

## Submitting changes

Please send a **GitHub Pull Request** with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). 
Please follow our coding conventions and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions for Smart contracts

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)
  * TODO
  
Thanks,
Tony.
